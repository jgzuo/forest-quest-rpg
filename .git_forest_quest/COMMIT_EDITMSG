fix: remove conflicting enemy movement logic from EnemyAI

The new EnemyAI system was conflicting with the original GameScene enemy
movement logic, causing enemies to stop at 50px and not attack the player.

Fix:
- Removed moveToPlayer() call from EnemyAI.updateEnemyAI()
- EnemyAI now only handles elite special attacks and boss phases
- Basic enemy movement is handled by original GameScene logic

Resolves: 敌人跑掉而不是跟玩家战斗的问题
