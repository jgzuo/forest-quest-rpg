fix: remove graphGraphics from container to prevent strokePath error

Problem:
- Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cut')
- Graphics objects in Container have issues with strokePath() in Phaser 3

Fix:
- Don't add graphGraphics to container
- Manage graphics position independently
- This allows strokePath() to work correctly
