fix: add enemy physics body configuration to prevent runaway speed

Problem:
- Enemies were running away from player instead of chasing
- Speed was accumulating without limit due to missing maxVelocity

Fix:
- Add enemy.body.setMaxVelocity(speed) to limit max speed
- Add enemy.body.setDrag(100) for natural movement
- Add enemy.body.setAllowGravity(false) for top-down movement

This ensures enemies move at their configured speed and don't accelerate
uncontrollably toward the player.
